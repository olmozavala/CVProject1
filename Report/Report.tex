For this project three approaches for Content Based Image Retrieval  (CBIR)
where implemented. The first approach is based on the comparison of color 
histograms, the second solution uses spectral histogram to do the comparison,
of images and the third approach uses SIFT features to compare images. 

\section{Description}
In this section the three methods used for CBIR are described. 

\subsection{Color histogram}
\label{sec_colorhist}
In this method we used the color (intensity filter) histogram  to 
compare images. The following steps summarizes the method:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Image pyramidization. } The images sizes where reduced
        to half their size in order to speed up the algorithm. The method used
        to compute the pyramids is \emph{Gaussian pyramid}, the first
        step of the Gaussian pyramid algorithm is to blur the image 
        using a Gaussian filter, and then scale down the image by 
        creating one pixel from the average color of four pixels.
    \item \textbf{Compute histograms.} The number of bins used
        for this method is 256, for each color band.
    \item \textbf{Compute histogram distances.} The distance between
        each pair of image histograms were computed using histogram intersection:
        \begin{equation}
            dist(hist_a,hist_b) = \sum_{i=1}^{256} \min( hist_a(i), hist_b(i))
        \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Images similarity}. The distance between the histograms
        of the images was used as the \emph{similarity} parameter. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Spectral histogram}
\label{sec_spechist}
This method uses spectral histograms for CBIR. The proposed steps
for this method are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Image pyramidization. } The images sizes where reduced
        to half their size in order to speed up the algorithm. The method used
        to compute the pyramids is \emph{Gaussian pyramid}, the first
        step of the Gaussian pyramid algorithm is to blur the image 
        using a Gaussian filter, and then scale down the image by 
        creating one pixel from the average color of four pixels.
    \item \textbf{Filter images}. Six filters plus the intensity
        filter are applied to each of the images. The filters 
        used and their corresponding masks are:
        \begin{equation}
            \begin{split}
                \frac{\partial I}{\partial x} & =  [0~-1~1] \\
                \frac{\partial I}{\partial y} & =  [0~-1~1]^T \\
                \frac{\partial I}{\partial x \partial x} & = [-1~2~-1] \\
                \frac{\partial I}{\partial y \partial y} & = [-1~2~-1]^T \\
                LoG(I(x,y))  & = ( x^2 + y^2 - \sqrt{2\sigma^2} ) e^{ -(x^2+y^2)/\sqrt{2\sigma^2}}\\
                Gauss(I(x,y))  & = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2} e^{ \frac{-(x.^2+y.^2)}{2\sigma^2}}\\
            \end{split}
        \end{equation}
        For the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) and Gaussian filters the size of the filter
        used is $5$ with a sigma value of $0.7$.
    \item \textbf{Compute spectral histograms.} The number of bins used
        for this method is 100, for each color band and for each filter. 
        For all the filters the range goes from [0 256], even when the values of some
        of the filters may go from [-256 256]. Several options for the range of the 
        histograms were tested, and the range of [0 256] gave the best results. 
        The 100 bins are evenly splitted from [0 256].
        Figure \ref{fig:spechist} shows an example of the spectral histograms.

        \end{figure}
    \item \textbf{Compute histogram distances.} The distance between
        each pair of image histograms were computed using histogram intersection:
        \begin{equation}
            dist(hist_a,hist_b) = \sum_{i=1}^{100} \min( hist_a(i), hist_b(i))
        \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Images similarity}. The distance between the histograms
        of the images was used as the \emph{similarity} parameter. 
\end{enumerate}
